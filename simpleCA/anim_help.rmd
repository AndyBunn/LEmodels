Generating an animation takes time. The dimensions of the landscape, the number of iterations, and the interval for the animation all influence the amount of time it takes. The interval slider shows the gap between iterations. E.g., if set to 5 the animation will start at the first iteration, then show the 5th, the 10th, the 15th, etc. Decreasing this will make for a smoothing visualization but take more time to generate and produce a larger file. The range of the interval slider is from zero to half the total number of iterations. The duration slider will set the run time of the GIF in seconds.
